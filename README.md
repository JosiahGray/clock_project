# What does it do?
It's a clock.  A digital clock to be more precise.
Controls include adding and subtracting hours, minutes, and seconds from the time, pausing the clock, and changing from 24 hour to 12 hour format

# What's mission impossible?
The missionImpossible branch just has a silly added feature.
